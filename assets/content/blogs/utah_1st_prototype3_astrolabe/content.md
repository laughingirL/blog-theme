###Overview
This prototype aims to trial an experience of exploration. It focus on intriguing the curiosity of audience toward constellations. 

###Inspiration
This prototype mainly gets the inspiration from the momemt appearing in the Assain Origin. It has a great gameplay when finding a certain constellation. And this moment drives us to explore how to mimic this expriences.

###Design Details
Exploration includes 2 part, the seeking and the achievement.

In the seeking phase, in the very beginning phase for the beginners, the design needs to make players getting some hints to following, avoiding them getting lost, like mountain in "Journey" and "Zelda", this game. This game uses the voice radar system which gives the players instant and indirect feedback about their movment. The closer they move towards the targeted constellation, the louder the voice responds. 

In the achievement phase, this prototype use gradual emergence and final visual/sound effect to enhance the feeling of achievement. Gives audiences several seconds to wait what they achieven in the process, it will amplify what they feel in the game and make them surprise.


<!-- This prototype aims to provide children a chance to realize how to identify the constellations. -->
