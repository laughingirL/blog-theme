###Overview
This prototype aims to explore a possible way between players and audiens in a party game.

###Inspiration and Motivation
This prototype gets the idea of a living stream to operate character in Pokemon by the tweets of audiences. 

We have interests to connect the audience in party and the real players, becuase there are always the incooridination between the real participants of a game and the exact number of party people, we always see someone watching other guys play, but have no room to join, like the Maria Party. We are interested into how to create a new immersive way to fix a party atmosphere.
