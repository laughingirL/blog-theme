##About me
I am Pluto She, currently a student of EAE program at the University of Utah.

I would like to demonstrate my dream world towards others. It is the reason why I find the medium of game. In my perspective, comparing other mediums, game not only show the world to audiences but also challenge people to create a certain flow or mode to overcome obstacles. Therefore, I am aiming to probe into how gameplay influences players.
In my spare time, I love to absorb interesting things, including reading, watching anime, playing the game, and travel. If you desire to express a story or a world you’d like to tell, welcome to share with me, I am interested in other’s dreaming world.
